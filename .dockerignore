#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, it is recommended to omit it:
#     "This file can be locked to specific versions (including build numbers) of dependencies."
#   The recommendation is to commit this file if and only if Pipfile.lock is intended to be ignored.
